# generate-random-turk
I wanted to test some biological sex prediction code I found online, so I made a streamlit web app that generates a random "turkish" person with a name using trnames and a picture using thispersondoesnotexist. This code is not remotely hosted, as opencv does not work quite well in streamlit, thus the demonstration of the code is below.
